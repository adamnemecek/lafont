# Animation of Yves Lafont's Interaction Combinators

[Interaction combinators][article] are a universal model of distributed
computation devised by Yves Lafont in 1997. They are a particular instance of
[Interaction nets][wikipedia]. Interaction nets are a graphical model of
computation also devised by Yves Lafont in 1990.

This project renders the computation of interaction combinators in a simplified
physical 3D world where agents are spheres and edges are invisible.
